# Hey, I'm Rob

I'm a Computer Science BSc student at Coventry University (Graduating late 2021).
I'm currently interested in:

 - Full stack web applications
 - Improving my CSS/Design skills
 - Maybe some game development in the future
 
Languages I use include Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java and some basic knowledge with C#, C++ and C.
